### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**Multi-Discriminator Generative Adversarial Network (MDGAN)**
**Network and Data Security Lab, UESTC, Chengdu, China**
Advisor: Prof. Tian Lan
* Focused on **Unsupervised Learning** in pulmonary medical images processing.
* Built an **Unsupervised Multi-Discriminator Generation Adversarial Network** combined with encoder for benign and malignant classification of lung nodules, calculated the MDGAN discriminator feature loss and image reconstruction loss to score the malignancy.
* **Conclusion**:Our method can obtain better results than other supervised learning methods (Autoencoder plus Decision tree; Multi-crop CNN) after training the model using only unlabeled benign lung nodules: **Accuracy** increased by approximately 20%, **Sensitivity** increased by approximately 10%, and **Specificity** increased by approximately 9% (Compared with Autoencoder plus Decision tree); Accuracy increased by approximately 8%, Sensitivity was similar, and Specificity increased by approximately 14%(Compared with Multi-crop CNN).

**Image classification website based on Dense-Net**
**School of information and software engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China**
Advisor: Dr. Li Yi
* Developed a website for classification with image recognition, independent editing, comments, collection and other personalized functions.
*	Trained the Dense-Net Network from dataset Cifar100, using TensorFlow in Python.
                                                                                                                                               
**Hackathon: Unit testing of a voting system**
**Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University,Netherland** 
**Course Projects**
Advisor: Dr. Marcello Bonsangue
* Applied Java for a voting system which is activated by an initiator.
*	Collects a vote from a group of external voter objects.
*	Implemented in Java an automated test environment for the unit testing.

**Lexer**
**School of information and software engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China**
Advisor: Dr. Erqiang Zhou
* Built a Lexer which can identify the validity of the text and output the judgement process and results.
*	Adopted a **top-down grammar**, which enables lexer to construct a predictive analytical chart, and judged the next step of the lexer by comparing the top of the stack and the input text.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara**
**Information Field (CNNIF)**

Advisor: Prof. Yufei Ding
*	Proposed Information Field to estimate the quality of a CNN architecture and guide the search process of designs.
*	Built a static optimizer to improve the CNN architectures at both the stage level and the kernel level to validate the effectiveness of Information field.
* Inspired by the optimizer at the kernel level, an unexplored convolution blocks and a new type of factorized kernel are designed.
*	Accomplished the Stage-level organizer and was responsible for the proofreading of the paper for AAAI, 2021.

**Specialized Quantization (SGQuant)**

Advisor: Prof. Yufei Ding
*	Proposed a specialized GNN quantization scheme, SGQuant, to systematically reduce the GNN memory consumption.
*	Designed a GNN-tailored quantization algorithm and a GNN quantization fine-tuning scheme to reduce memory consumption.
*	Investigated the multi-granularity quantization strategy that operates at different levels (components, graph topology, and layers) of GNN computation.
*	Offered an automatic bit-selecting (ABS) to pinpoint the most appropriate quantization bits for the above multi-granularity quantization.

**Sliding-Channel Convolutions (DSXplore)**

Advisor: Prof. Yufei Ding
*	Proposed DeepXplore, which is an efficient deep separable convolution on GPU.
*	Designed a novel deep separable convolution, sliding convolution, featured with channel overlapping that can significantly overcome the accuracy drop from the existing convolutions at algorithmic optimization.
*	Reduced the atomic operation during the forward and backward phase by leveraging the output-centric and input-centric thread mapping techniques at implementation level
*	Fully integrated DSXplore with the Pytorch framework to improve programmability.


**Network and Data Security Lab, UESTC, Chengdu, China**
**Multi-Discriminator Generative Adversarial Network (MDGAN)**

Advisor: Prof. Tian Lan
*	Focused on Unsupervised Learning in pulmonary medical images processing.
*	Built an Unsupervised Multi-Discriminator Generation Adversarial Network combined with encoder for benign and malignant classification of lung nodules, calculated the MDGAN discriminator feature loss and image reconstruction loss to score the malignancy.
*	Accomplished the Image Preprocessing of pulmonary nodules in the experiment and was responsible for the translation and typesetting of the paper for IEEE Access, 2019.


**School of information and software engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China**
**Image classification website based on Dense-Net**

Advisor: Dr. Li Yi
* Developed a website for classification with image recognition, independent editing, comments, collection and other personalized functions.
*	Trained the Dense-Net Network from dataset Cifar100, using TensorFlow in Python.
                                                                                                                 **Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Netherland **                          
**Hackathon: Unit testing of a voting system**
**Course Projects**  

Advisor: Dr. Marcello Bonsangue
* Applied Java for a voting system which is activated by an initiator.
*	Collects a vote from a group of external voter objects.
*	Implemented in Java an automated test environment for the unit testing.

**School of information and software engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China**
**Lexer**

Advisor: Dr. Erqiang Zhou
* Built a Lexer which can identify the validity of the text and output the judgement process and results.
*	Adopted a top-down grammar, which enables lexer to construct a predictive analytical chart, and judged the next step of the lexer by comparing the top of the stack and the input text.
